# About this image
A Docker image based on "Microsoft SQL Server" by Microsoft with initdb added.

# Usage

## The Server

This Docker image is designed to do the same as the origian SQL Server image (https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server), additionaly enabling you to provide the database initialization scripts in a convenient manner.

Simply copy your sql files into `/docker-entrypoing-initdb` and they will be executed in lexicografical order during container startup (`docker run`), not during image build time!

```
 FROM horizoncrafts/mssql-with-initdb

 COPY mssql-init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

You can also just use this image and bind the sql scripts from the host:

```
docker run -v your-sql-init-folder:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ -p 1433:1433 -d horizoncrafts/mssql-with-initdb
```

Or, in docker-compose yaml file:

```
mssql:
    image: horizoncrafts/mssql-with-initdb
    container_name: mssql
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: your-sql-init-folder
        target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
      - type: bind
        source: your-persistent-database-data-folder
        target: /var/opt/mssql
    environment:
          ACCEPT_EULA: your-EULA-acceptance-Y-or-N
          SA_PASSWORD: aStrongPassword
```
This example additionally shows how to attain data persistency. However, note that this combination usually makes sens only for the first time when `your-persistent-database-data-folder` is not yet initialized. After that you would rather not put anything in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. 
When on macOS and mounting such a volume I usually add `consistency: delegated`. That - at least for me - increases the database performce at the expance of the speed of synchronisation between container and host. Read more:

## The command line tool

There are plenty of lighter `sqlcmd` images available on dockerhub. However, if you already use this one you can "exec into" the running container and invoke `sqlcmd` (the PATH env is extended with `/opt/mssql-tools/bin`). You can also use provided function of running the container as a command, for example:
```
docker run -rm --link from_image_name:to_host_name horizoncrafts/mssql-with-initdb sqlcmd -S to_host_name -U sa -P yourStrongOne -Q "select 'Hello World'"
```

Skip the link `--link from_image_name:to_host_name` part if you don't want to connect to a local container. Use `-it` docker option and skip `-Q "select 'Hello World'"` sqlcmd part to enter interactive mode.

## What additionally happens inside this image?

1. There are series of commands put to execute in background. The loop checks once in `$MSSQL_SLEEP_TIME` (default 1 second) if the server is accessible. When that happens, each sql file found in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` is executed against the database.
1. The sql server process is initiated immediately, so it can be ready for the sleeping commands.
1. If instead of `sqlservr` other command is specified, in particular `sqlcmd`, it is just executed. The server is not started, no init scripts executed in loop.
